Hi! My name is André Steingreß, I'm from **Linz, Austria**. 

From 2013 on, I am co-host of the <a href="http://dtr.fm">Donau Tech Radio (DTR) podcast</a>. DTR is a periodically published podcast with over 130 episodes (as of 2017/09). It's one of the first and maybe the most popular podcast on software engineering and gadgets here in Austria.

If you would like to contact me for project or consulting work or just to get in touch with me, please use either Xing or Twitter as these are the social networks I use (or at least check) frequently.
