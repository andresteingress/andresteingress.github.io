Hi! My name is Andre Steingress, I'm based in Linz, *Austria*.

I am passionate about working on server-side applications usingÂ <strong>Groovy</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong> or other JVM-based programming languages. My past work was largely in the Java field, so I have experiences with a bunch of frameworks, libraries and servers in this cosmos ;-) Think NoSQL, Hibernate, Spring Framework, JEE, Apache Solr, Elastic Search, Grails and a bazillion of libraries that I had to use every now and then. 

As of 2013, I am host of the <a href="http://dtr.fm">Donau Tech Radio" (DTR) podcast</a>, together with Thomas Einwaller. DTR is a periodically published podcast in German about software engineering, gadgets and other geek stuff.

If you would like to contact me, please use either Xing or Twitter as these are the services I use quite frequently.
