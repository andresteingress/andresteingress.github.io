Hi! My name is André Steingreß, I'm from **Linz, Austria**. 

I'm working as developer and consultant in software development projects the last 15 years.

From 2013 on, I am co-hosting <a href="http://dtr.fm">Donau Tech Radio (DTR) podcast</a>. DTR is a periodically published podcast with over 130 episodes (as of 2017/09). It's one of the first and maybe the most popular podcast on software engineering and gadgets here in Austria.

Feel free to visit [my company's web page](https://www.appcare.at) and contact me over there.
