In our last blog posts, we introduced seemingly rather small features that hve been added to Java 9. We sort of avoided the elephant in the room so far, however, when talking about Java 9 features there is no way around it: the new Java module system.

Java 9 comes with a new API for navigating and filtering stack traces: `StackWalker`. Based on the Stream API, it provides a way to move through a stream of stack frames, including on-demand loading of stack frames and retaining of the referred to `Class` objects.
