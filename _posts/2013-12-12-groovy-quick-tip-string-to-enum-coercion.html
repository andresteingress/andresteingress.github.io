With all the fuss about the new closure to SAM type coercion in Groovy 2.2 [<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+2.2+release+notes">0</a>] I was remembered of another neat coercion feature some of my work colleagues seemed not to know about.

<h3>Strings and Enumerations in Groovy</h3>

Since Groovy 1.7.6 the language supports a feature called "String to enum coercion" [<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-4501">1</a>]. Well, that might say it all, but let's have a look what this means with a small code example:

{% highlight groovy %} 

enum Day {
    Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
}

 {% endhighlight %}

Let's assume we have an enum type called <tt>Day</tt>, resembling an enumeration of all the week days. If we wanted to get the enumeration value for a given string, we would have to do something like that in <em>Java code</em>:

{% highlight java %} 

Day sunday = Day.valueOf("Sunday");

 {% endhighlight %}

Groovy comes with a nicer way of coercing a string to an arbitrary enumeration using the <tt>as</tt> operator:

{% highlight groovy %} 
Day sunday = "Sunday" as Day
 {% endhighlight %}

The <tt>as</tt> operator can actually be left aside in this case which leaves us with:

{% highlight groovy %} 
Day sunday = "Sunday"
 {% endhighlight %}

Note that this feature not only works for plain <tt>java.lang.String</tt> instances but also for <tt>GString</tt> instances:

{% highlight groovy %} 
Day sunday = "${ ['Sun', 'day'].join()}"
 {% endhighlight %}

The coercion also works in the opposite direction, if we wanted a string from our enumeration value we can simply do:

{% highlight groovy %} 
String day = Day.Sunday
 {% endhighlight %}

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The String to enum coercion is especially useful if your are dealing with strings coming for example from HTTP request instances and you need a fast way to retrieve an enumeration value.
