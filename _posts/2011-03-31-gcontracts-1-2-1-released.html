I am proud to announce that GContracts 1.2.1 has just been released and is available in the Central Maven repository [<a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/gcontracts/gcontracts-core/1.2.1/">0</a>] and at Github [<a href="https://github.com/andresteingress/gcontracts/downloads">1</a>].

This release includes bug fixes and enhancements.

<h3>@Contracted gets Optional</h3>

The most popular ticket has been [<a href="http://gcontracts.lighthouseapp.com/projects/71511/tickets/8">08</a>]. GContracts 1.2.0 introduced the <tt>@Contracted</tt> annotation which was mandatory on every annotated class or interface. This turned out to be too restrictive and confusing, ticket #8 resolved that issue: <code>@Contracted</code> is now optional and will otherwise be injected automatically. 

<h3>@Target and @Retention Injection on @AnnotationContract</h3>

All <code>@AnnotationContract</code> annotations are injected with appropriate <code>@Target</code> and <code>@Retention</code> annotations if not specified. 

<h3>Release Notes</h3>

[<a href="http://gcontracts.lighthouseapp.com/projects/71511/tickets/13">13</a>] Automtically infer @Retention and @Target into Annotation Contracts
