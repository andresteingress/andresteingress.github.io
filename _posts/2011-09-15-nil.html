<h4>No Blog Posts</h4>

Recently there haven't been many posts on this blog. The reason is that I am working on several projects, but unfortunately none of them involves Grails or Groovy. But since I enjoy writing technical articles, I decided to extend the topic range of this blog with mobile application programming in Android. 

<h4>Why Android?</h4>

The reason is, that all of my current projects are Android projects (the only exception is a tiny, single JEE project ;)) and I really feel there is a high-demand on good articles about mobile application patterns or best practices for Android developers.

I swear to appropriately tag blog posts, if you have no interest in Android or related topics please subscribe to the Groovy, Grails or GContracts tag.

Cheers, Andre Steingress
