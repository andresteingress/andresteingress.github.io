For all my german speaking readers. Some weeks ago I started a German podcast with Thomas Einwaller from troii. The podcast is called "Donau Tech Radio" (DTR) and is mostly suited around development stuff and experiences from our current projects.

<a href="http://dtr.fm">DTR</a> is published every one to two weeks and is available in the iTunes store [<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/at/podcast/id710904862">0</a>].
