The <tt>groovy.util.logging</tt> package comes with a bunch of annotations. Each of the annotations adds logging capabilities of a particular logging library to the class where it is applied.

For example, let us have a look at the <tt>@Log4j</tt> [<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/api/groovy/util/logging/Log4j.html">0</a>] annotation. As its name implies, it is used in projects that use the Log4j logging library [<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">1</a>]. Getting <tt>@Log4j</tt> into play for a Groovy class is simple, we can do so by just annotating the class with the <tt>@Log4j</tt> annotation on the type level:

{% highlight java %} 
@Log4j
class ItemRepository {

    void create(String name)  {

        // ...
        log.info "created a new item named ${name}, identifier ${item.id}"

    }
}
 {% endhighlight %}

As you might have guessed from the source code example, the <tt>@Log4j</tt> annotation does not "only" annotate the class. It triggers an AST transformation that adds a <tt>private static final Logger</tt> field to the <tt>ItemRepository</tt> class. That field can now be used as if it were manually specified in this class.

There is another cool feature that is only visible from the AST browser in groovyConsole. When we have a look for the code that is generated for the code line above,

{% highlight java %} 
log.info "created a new item named ${name}, identifier ${item.id}"
 {% endhighlight %} 

we can see in the "class generation" compile phase the code was changed to

{% highlight java %} 
log.isInfoEnabled() ? log.info "created a new item named ${name}, identifier ${item.id}" : ""
 {% endhighlight %} 

Isnt' that cool? The AST transformation automatically detected a GString and therefore wrapped the <tt>info</tt> method call in a conditional block that is only executed when the INFO log level is active at runtime.

If we would have written something like 

{% highlight java %} 
log.info "created a new item"
 {% endhighlight %} 

the AST transformation would see that the argument is of type <tt>java.lang.String</tt> and wouldn't add a conditional log statement.

I know that this isn't a particular issue to Log4j, as Burt Beckwidth already explained here [<a href="http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=81">2</a>]. But be aware that <tt>@Log4j</tt> isn't the only logging annotation Groovy provides. In fact it's a so called <tt>@Log</tt> variant annotation. Besides the original <tt>@Log</tt> for the Java logging support, there are a bunch of such variant annotations: <tt>@Log4j</tt>, <tt>@Slf4j</tt>, <tt>@Commons</tt> and <tt>@Log4j2</tt> included in the current Groovy 2.2 release candidate [<a href="http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/release-candidate-for-groovy-2-2">3</a>].

However, I've found that this is a Groovy feature that is not widely known though I'm using it every day. So keep on groovying with Groovy's logging annotations!
