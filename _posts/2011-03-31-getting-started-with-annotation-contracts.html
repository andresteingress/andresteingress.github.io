Annotation Contracts is one of the new features of GContracts 1.2 [<a href="http://blog.andresteingress.com/2011/03/11/gcontracts-1-2-0-released/">0</a>]. The main principle behind is to reuse small but reoccurring parts of pre- and post-condition expressions.

This article is about creating a simple <code>@NotNull</code> annotation contract. <code>@NotNull</code> can be applied on method parameters in order to automatically add null checks to the method's precondition. 

<h3>Let's Get Started</h3>

The first step when creating an annotation contract is to create a custom annotation, in this case <code>@NotNull</code>.

{% highlight groovy %} 
@Precondition
@AnnotationContract({ it != null })
public @interface NotNull {}
 {% endhighlight %}

Depending on whether the expression should be part of the pre- or post-condition, the author needs to specify <code>@Precondition</code> or <code>@Postcondition</code> (from the <code>org.gcontracts.annotations.meta</code> package).

The expression which is supposed to be added to the precondition is specified with the <code>@AnnotationContract</code> annotation. The <code>@AnnotationContract</code> annotation has a single annotation closure which has to hold a boolean expression. The value of the parameter can be referenced with <code>it</code>.

Note: <code>@Retention</code> and <tt>@Target</tt> are optional. GContracts will inject those meta-annotations if not available in the annotation contract definition. Currently, only <code>ElementType.PARAMETER</code> is supported. 

<h3>How to Apply the Annotation Contract</h3>

Applying the annotation contracts is pretty straight-forward. Just add it to the appropriate parameter(s):

{% highlight groovy %} 
class Tester {
    def doSomething(@NotNull param) { println "hello world: ${param}" }
}
 {% endhighlight %}

During the compilation process GContracts will inject a newly created precondition for method <code>doSomething</code> that will check parameter <code>param</code>. With a precondition already specified, the null check will be merged into the existing boolean expression by conjunction. 

<h3>Summary</h3>

Annotation contracts are a simple way to reuse micro contracts, i.e. null checks, empty strings checks, range checks etc. GContracts 1.2 provides a neat way to create annotation contracts with the help of annotation closures.
