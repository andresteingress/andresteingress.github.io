This article is the first one of a series that has been inspired by Joch Bloch's "Concrete Java" classic. As a matter of fact, most of the knowledge certainly hasn't been uncovered by me but has been told every now and than in various places.

<h3>Strings the Groovy way</h3>

According to the Javadoc of <tt>groovy.lang.GString</tt> [<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/api/groovy/lang/GString.html">0</a>], a Groovy String  

<blockquote>represents a String which contains embedded values such as "hello there ${user} how are you?" which can be evaluated lazily.</blockquote>

What immidiately stands out is the fact that strings "can be" evaluated lazily. That is where our journey to GString land starts.

<h3>GStrings and variable scopes</h3>

Whenever you use a <tt>String</tt> in Groovy it could either by of type <tt>java.lang.String</tt> or <tt>groovy.lang.GString</tt>. The choice depends whether the String expression holds a placeholder value or not at compile time. As <tt>java.lang.String</tt> has been implemented as a final class, Groovy is forced to convert between GString and String objects, depending whether the appropriate type information has been specified or not.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

{% highlight groovy %} 
class Logger {
    boolean infoEnabled = false

    void info(def msg) { 
        if (!infoEnabled) return 

        println msg
    }
}
def logger = new Logger(infoEnabled: true)
logger.info ("method executed in ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms")

output:
method executed in ...
 {% endhighlight %}

one could assume that the GString object is lazy evaluated only if the logger is activated on info level. But as we see if we add a simple println statement to the GString, this is not the case: 

{% highlight groovy %} 
def logger = new Logger(infoEnabled: false)
logger.info ("method executed in ${println 'test'; System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms")

output:
test
 {% endhighlight %}

This directly leads to the first rule of thumb when dealing with GStrings:

<strong>GString place holder values are always given to the internal GString constructor</strong>

The compiler translates the code to something equivalent like this:

{% highlight groovy %} 
logger.info (new GString("method executed in ", { println 'test'; System.currentTimeMillis() - start} as String, " ms")
 {% endhighlight %}

This shows even better that place holder values are directly converted to their string representation in the place where the GString definition occurs. As class <tt>GString</tt> does not descend from <tt>java.lang.String</tt>, <tt>GString</tt> instances are converted by Groovy's <tt>as</tt> method whenever type <tt>String</tt> is actually needed for a variable:

{% highlight groovy %} 
def gs = "this is my ${'GString'}"
assert gs instanceof GString

String s = gs
assert s instanceof String
 {% endhighlight %}

If we have a look at the <tt>GString#toString()</tt> implementation, we will see that a <tt>StringWriter</tt> is used to build a new <tt>String</tt> instance each time <tt>GString#toString()</tt> is invoked.

{% highlight java %} 
public String toString() {
    StringWriter buffer = new StringWriter();
    try {
        writeTo(buffer);
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
        throw new StringWriterIOException(e);
    }
    return buffer.toString();
}
 {% endhighlight %}

If we digg further deeper into <tt>StringWriter#toString()</tt> implementation we see that the String instance is created by an internal character array. 

{% highlight java %} 
public synchronized String toString() {
    return new String(value, 0, count);
}
 {% endhighlight %}

<tt>GString#toString()</tt> is not only called when converting a <tt>GString</tt> to a <tt>String</tt>, but also internally when computing the GString length, retrieving a subsequence

"test" == "Test" executes GString#toString().equals()
