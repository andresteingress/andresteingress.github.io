Groovy 2.2 [0] comes with some neat additions to Groovysh [<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Shell">1</a>]. Groovysh is a command-line application that allows to evaluate expressions, define classes and run simple experiments. 

The groovysh program comes with every Groovy installation. After extracting/installing the Groovy distribution, it can be found in the "bin/" folder.

Once you start groovysh a command prompt comes up.

{% highlight groovy %} 
âžœ  ~  groovysh
Groovy Shell (2.2.0, JVM: 1.7.0_21)
Type 'help' or '\h' for help.

<h3>The doc command</h3>

In Groovy 2.2 groovysh gained some additional features and refinements. One of them is the so-called <tt>doc</tt> command, representing the newest addition to the groovysh set of commands. 

{% highlight groovy %} 
Available commands:
  help      (\h ) Display this help message
  ?         (\? ) Alias to: help
  exit      (\x ) Exit the shell
  quit      (\q ) Alias to: exit
  import    (\i ) Import a class into the namespace
  display   (\d ) Display the current buffer
  clear     (\c ) Clear the buffer and reset the prompt counter.
  show      (\S ) Show variables, classes or imports
  inspect   (\n ) Inspect a variable or the last result with the GUI object browser
  purge     (\p ) Purge variables, classes, imports or preferences
  edit      (\e ) Edit the current buffer
  load      (\l ) Load a file or URL into the buffer
  .         (\. ) Alias to: load
  save      (\s ) Save the current buffer to a file
  record    (\r ) Record the current session to a file
  history   (\H ) Display, manage and recall edit-line history
  alias     (\a ) Create an alias
  set       (\= ) Set (or list) preferences
  register  (\rc) Registers a new command with the shell
  doc       (\D ) Opens a browser window displaying the doc for the argument
 {% endhighlight %}

The <tt>doc</tt> command is a simple but useful one. It allows for looking up the JavaDoc/GroovyDoc documentation of the specified class. 

{% highlight groovy %} 
groovy:000> help doc

usage: doc [<class>]

Opens a browser window displaying the doc for the argument.
 {% endhighlight %}

As can be seen in the documentation printed above, the doc command can be called with a single <tt>class</tt> argument, specifying the fully-qualified class name. To open the documentation for <tt>groovy.lang.GString</tt>, <tt>doc</tt> just needs to be called with the class name as the only argument.

{% highlight groovy %} 
groovy:000> doc groovy.lang.GString
 {% endhighlight %}

The <tt>doc</tt> command implementation primarily uses Java's <tt>java.awt.Desktop</tt> class which provides a <tt>browse</tt> method for opening URLs in the system-specific browser. As this functionality isn't supported on all platforms (e.g. Linux is not supported), one needs to set a <tt>BROWSER</tt> or <tt>GROOVYSH_BROWSER</tt> environment variable to use this feature.

{% highlight groovy %} 
groovy:000> doc groovy.lang.GString
http://groovy.codehaus.org/gapi/groovy/lang/GString.html
Browser could not be opened caused by missing platform support for 'java.awt.Desktop'. Please set a GROOVYSH_BROWSER or BROWSER environment variable referring to the browser binary to solve this issue.
 {% endhighlight %}

Once the browser is referred to accordingly, <tt>doc</tt> opens the JavaDoc/GroovyDoc URL. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The <tt>doc</tt> command represents the latest addition to the groovysh command set. It allows for opening a JavaDoc/GroovyDoc page to a given full-qualified class name.
