My name is Andre Steingress, I'm based in Linz, <strong>Austria</strong>.

I am passionate about working on server-side applications using <strong>Groovy</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong> or other JVM-based programming languages. My past works was largely in the Java field, so I have experiences with a bunch of frameworks, libraries and servers in this cosmos ;-) Think NoSQL, Hibernate, Spring Framework, JEE, Apache Solr, Elastic Search, Grails and a bazillion of libraries that I had to use every now and then. 

Since the release of the Android SDK, I am doing (more or less small) Android applications besides working on server-side stuff.

I am project lead of <strong>GContracts</strong> - a Design by Contract extension for Groovy, <strong>committer to the Groovy programming language</strong> and engaged in many other open-source stuff I care about.

I regularly blog and write articles for JavaMagazin (Germany), GroovyMag (US), Java Journal (US).
